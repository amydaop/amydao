    <p>Rush hour is not necessarily my favourite series , but #1 and #2 are the best picks.
         Not only are they action packed but the humour is hilarious and an all time classic (at least for me.)</p>
    <p>A lot of people don't like this series, but I have personally loved it since I was a kid.</p>
    <p>note: I am not sorry Mr. zaREEEEEEmba</p>
